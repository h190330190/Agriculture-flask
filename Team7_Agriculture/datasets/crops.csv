CROP,SOIL TYPE1,SEASON,TEMPERATURE,RAINFALL,SUGGESTION
ARHAR,Black Soil,Rabi,30-350C,60-65cm,The seed rate and fertilizer doses to the sesamum crop should be reduced to half of the recommended for pure sesamum crop.
COTTON,Black Soil,Kharif,90C,85-110cm,Good drainage system to remove excess moisture
GRAM,Black Soil,Rabi,25-30C,40-50cm,Foliar spray of DAP 2% on 30 and 45 DAS to enhance the grain yield of Gram
GROUNDNUT,Sandy loam,Kharif,27-30C,50-100cm,application of 1 0 – 1 2 t ha-1 of chicken manure or 20 t ha-1 of well-decomposed farm yard-manure should be used and completed at least 1 month before sowing. This should be mixed into the soil for good plant development and to improve the soil structure
MAIZE,Alluvial Soil,Kharif,21-27C,50-100cm,"Sow best quality seeds. When you harvest, choose the biggest cobs. Keep these cobs. For sowing, take only the best- shaped grains from the centre of the cobs. If you choose your seeds in this way, you will have a better harvest. Seed dressing is also useful"
MOONG,Sandy loam,Kharif,27-30C,60-75cm,Harvest Moong dal when 85% of pods are matured
PADDY,Alluvial Soil,Kharif,25-35C,175-300cm,"incorporate all fertilizer K before the last soil puddling before transplanting or topdress all K within 10?15 days after direct seeding. At rates > 30 kg K2O/ha, apply 50% basal and 50% at early panicle initiation. Split K in at least two doses if soil is sandy with leaching."
RAPESEED AND MUSTARD,Sandy loam,Rabi,15-25C,60-100cm,"Irrigate after an interval of 3 weeks of sowing,Apply good amount of organic manures in soil"
SUGARCANE,Black Soil,Kharif,20-26C,150cm," Sugarcane intercropping with short duration vegetable crops like Cabbage & cauliflower were found to be highly beneficial for the farmers. In areas of adequate irrigation, sowing one row of soybean or black gram helps to increase the soil fertility and sugarcane yield."
WHEAT,Alluvial Soil,Rabi,54-77C,25-75cm,Try nitrogen fertiliser. Using a nitrogen rich fertiliser has been shown to improve yield without sacrificing quality and is a much more efficient choice compared to simple farmyard manure. Try green manure
RICE,Alluvial Soil,Kharif,21-37C,>100cm,"increasing the yield potential of rice are being used, such as population improvement, ideotype breeding, heterosis breeding, wide hybridization, genetic engineering, and molecular breeding."
BARLEY,Alluvial Soil,Rabi,12-25C,25-75cm,"For timely sown irrigated crop, 60 kg/ha of N, 30 kg/ha of P and 20kg/ha of K. For late sown irrigated crop, 60 kg/ha of N, 30 kg/ha of P and 20kg/ha of K. For malt barley, 80 kg/ha of N, 40 kg/ha of P and 20kg/ha of K. For rainfed crop in plain region, 30 kg/ha of N, 20 kg/ha of P and 20 kg/ha of K.  For rainfed crop in hilly region, 40 kg/ha of N, 20 kg/ha of P and 20kg/ha of K."
TEA,Loamy Soil,Kharif,28-32C,250-300cm,"proper dose of nitrogenous fertilizers such as ammonium sulphate should be given to soil. Although tea requires heavy rainfall for its growth, stagnant water is injurious to its roots"
COFFEE,Sandy loam,Rabi,23-28C,100-200cm,"Thorough soil preparation prior to planting, and maintenance of pH between 5.2- 6.3, good rooting and that nutrients are readily available. It is therefore important to balance the cations in the soil at this stage"
TURMERIC,Sandy loam,Rabi,20-30C,150-225cm,"Pits are filled with well decomposed cattle manure or compost, seed rhizomes are placed over it then covered with soil. The optimum spacing in furrows and ridges is 45-60 cm between the rows and 25 cm between the plants. A seed rate of 2,500 kg of rhizomes is required for planting one hectare of turmeric."
ONION,Alluvial Soil,Kharif,13-24C,65-75cm,"Onion crop can be grown successfully on heavy soil with application of organic manure prior to planting and preparation of the field for onion cultivation should be very good. The optimum pH range, regardless of soil type, is 6.0 - 7.5, but onion can also be grown in mild alkaline soils"
POTATO,Loamy Soil,Rabi,15-20C,120-200cm,"The two key yield components of potato are tuber numbers per unit area, and tuber size or weight. Increased yields come from achieving the optimum tuber numbers, maintaining a green leaf canopy, and increasing tuber size and weight."
RUBBER,Loamy Soil,Rabi,20-35C,>200cm,"Latex flow during tapping of the rubber plant Hevea brasilensis is the crucial parameter for rubber yield. The extent of latex flow depends on water circulation in the tissues surrounding the latex-producing cells. Water, and therefore latex flow, can be stimulated by ethylene or auxin treatment of the bark."
JUTE,Alluvial Soil,Rabi,24-37C,160-200cm, Using high yielding variety seeds. Use of modern irrigation methods so as to obtain more amount of water. Crop rotation so as to increase the fertility of the soil.
JOWAR,Sandy loam,Kharif,27-32C,45cm,"Urea, T.S.P,M.P and D.A.P fertilizers"
